    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Are “Benefits Cards”?</h2>
      <p>
        Benefits-focused credit cards charge a higher annual fee in exchange for a bundle of perks: airport lounges, hotel status, airline advantages, travel credits, insurance and concierge services. Instead of maximising raw cashback, these products aim to improve your travel experience and protection.
      </p>
      <p>
        The challenge is that the headline list of perks doesn’t show how often you will realistically use them. Evaluating a benefits card means translating those features into <strong>your own yearly trips, stays and spending patterns</strong>, not an abstract “frequent traveller” profile.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Types of benefits -->
    <section id="types" class="section">
      <h2>Main Types of Premium Card Benefits</h2>
      <p>
        Most premium cards combine several benefit categories. Common examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Airport lounges</strong> – Access to network lounges or airline-operated spaces, sometimes with guest passes and usage limits per year.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hotel status</strong> – Automatic elite tiers that bring room upgrades, late checkout, bonus points or breakfast benefits at partnered chains.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Airline perks</strong> – Priority boarding, extra baggage, seat selection discounts or companion tickets linked to a specific carrier.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Statement credits</strong> – Annual or monthly credits that reimburse selected travel, dining, rides or subscription purchases.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Concierge &amp; experiences</strong> – Booking help, event access and curated experiences for dining or entertainment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Insurance &amp; protections</strong> – Enhanced travel coverage, purchase protection and extended warranty on eligible transactions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A “good” benefits card is one where you can make realistic use of several of these categories each year – not just admire the brochure.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Value vs fee -->
    <section id="value" class="section">
      <h2>Putting a Realistic Value on Perks</h2>
      <p>
        To work out whether a benefits card is worth its annual fee, it helps to build a simple personal estimate rather than rely on marketing examples. A practical approach:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Count how many trips you usually take per year (weekend vs long-haul, solo vs family).</li>
        <li>Estimate realistic lounge usage – not every flight, only those where you’d actually arrive early.</li>
        <li>Value hotel status perks at what you would <em>truly</em> pay extra for (e.g., breakfast or late checkout), not the highest theoretical value.</li>
        <li>Treat statement credits as valuable only if they match spending you would do anyway.</li>
        <li>Consider the opportunity cost: could a cheaper card plus paid lounges or simple accommodation work out better?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If your conservative estimate of yearly benefit value is consistently higher than the annual fee, the card may fit your profile. If the math only works with optimistic assumptions, it may be more of a luxury purchase than a rational upgrade.
      </p>

    <!-- Risks & fine print -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Fine Print, Restrictions and Common Pitfalls</h2>
      <p>
        Premium benefits often come with eligibility rules, caps and regional limits. Examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lounge access restricted to the cardholder, with guest fees or visit caps.</li>
        <li>Hotel status valid only at certain brands or in specific regions.</li>
        <li>Travel credits limited to certain merchants, booking channels or currencies.</li>
        <li>Insurance coverage that requires paying the full trip with the card.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Before applying, always read the full benefit guide and check how many of the perks actually apply in the countries you travel to most often.
