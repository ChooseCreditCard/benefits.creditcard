    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Counts as a “Premium” Card Benefit?</h2>
      <p>Premium credit cards bundle extra features on top of basic rewards. Common benefits include airport lounge access, travel and purchase insurance, hotel and airline status boosts, concierge services and credits for specific categories like travel, dining or subscriptions.</p>
      <p>These perks are designed to justify higher annual fees. The challenge for cardholders is separating headline features that sound impressive from benefits they will actually use often enough to create real value over the long term.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Benefits Are Structured and Triggered</h2>
      <p>Most benefits are governed by detailed terms: some apply automatically when you pay with the card, others require activation in the app or enrollment with a partner. Statement credits, for example, may reset monthly, quarterly or annually and often only cover specific merchants or categories.</p>
      <p>Travel protections usually activate when you charge the trip to the card, while status boosts and lounge access may rely on card-linked memberships that need periodic verification. Understanding these triggers helps avoid missed benefits and frustration at the point of use.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Travel Perks: Lounges, Upgrades and Insurance</h2>
      <p>Travel-focused benefits often include lounge programs, fast-track security lanes, free checked bags, priority boarding and hotel upgrades. Some cards provide their own lounge network access, while others rely on third-party programs that have separate rules and guest policies.</p>
      <p>Insurance can cover trip delays, cancellations, baggage issues and rental-car damage, but coverage levels, exclusions and claim procedures vary widely. Reading the actual policy wording is essential if you plan to rely on these protections for high-cost trips.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Credits, Discounts and Lifestyle Extras</h2>
      <p>Statement credits are a major part of many premium cards. These might offset travel bookings, rideshare services, food delivery, streaming subscriptions or global entry fees. Some credits are easy to use, while others are tied to specific brands or narrow time windows.</p>
      <p>Cards may also offer lifestyle coupons, partner discounts, event access and concierge services. These can be useful if they align with your habits, but they are easy to overvalue in marketing materials if they do not match your actual spending patterns.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Calculating the Real Value of Benefits</h2>
      <p>To judge a premium card, estimate how often you will use each benefit and assign a realistic cash value—often lower than the “full retail” number quoted by issuers. If you rarely visit lounges or use specific partners, those perks may be worth much less than advertised.</p>
      <p>Subtract the annual fee and any incremental costs (such as higher FX fees or companion card charges) from your estimated yearly benefit value. A card is usually compelling only if the benefits you genuinely use comfortably exceed the cost of holding it.</p>
